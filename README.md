#ebaytracker
--------------

A simple Python script that checks the price of a eBay listing and notifies you via email when the price hits a threshold.
Relies on SMTP and is currently designed around Gmail but can be adapted for other mail services.

Uses the command line to request user input of their Gmail/listing info.
Can be ran in the background to run the test after a certain period for a constant update.
